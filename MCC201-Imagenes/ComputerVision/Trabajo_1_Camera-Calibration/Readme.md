## Camera Calibration

In this work, we try to detect patterns (ellipses or rings), calculate camera coefficients and calibrate camera (distort coefficients).

## Dependencies

We need to install OpenCV to c++, so just run (in ubuntu):

    sudo apt install libopencv-dev

* Once you installed OpenCV in your PC, you can start to follow next steps.

## Run project

Just go to `camera-calibration` directory and run:

      ./compileFile
